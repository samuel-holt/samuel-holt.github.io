### Intro

Hey! I need a portfolio to showcase my mad web skillz + a platform to blog about movies,
conspiracy theories, fantasy fiction, food, travel and the environment, and possibly some cool new web stuff. These
topics have nothing to do with boosting my Google PageRank, I'm genuinely interested in all of them... Heh heh heh...
 suckers...

The first post is always the most difficultest, so don't get you're hopes up.

### What to blog about?

I've been wanting to do some personal blog posts for a wee while now, and to be honest I really can't think of much
to contribute to the internet, but here are a few ideas:

1. **Movies:** I'm a pretty huge movie fan, I did a semester of Film studies or something at university,
and at the lectures I showed up to, I found myself thinking, "Hey, I'm a really huge movie fan". What I think might be
good to do is like a movie-a-day challenge for a year/decade or somesuch. Watch some random ass movie each day,
talk about it, critique it, spoil the ending, etc.
2. **Web stuff:** Tutorials for getting into web design and developery shenanigans. Building sites and apps is pretty
much
 my biggest passion, there's something cool about taking an idea, bringing it to life,
 and taking it to the masses. I'm interested in web design tools, building sweet user interfaces,
 mucking around with cutting edge HTML5 features and just general problem solving.
3. **Food, travel and environmental issues:** I'm not good at cooking, and I don't travel much,
but these are the kinda things I
should really be doing... Maybe I should wait until my thirties... Also the environment, man,
it's like a total bummer right now, dude.
4. **Conspiracy theories:** I would like discuss and share my many outrageous conspiracy theories,
but the government is probably monitoring this blog, so I'll just stick the more docile ones for now
5. **Books:** I don't read a very diverse range of books, but maybe that's a good thing,
or maybe it's telling of my many personality disorders.

Got any better ideas? Send them [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) and I shall give them due consideration.
