Hey hey hey! Thanks for stopping by, most About pages are generally pretty dull, and this one is likely no exception.

I'm probably going to yammer on for a couple of paragraphs about who I am, where I'm from and why I'm writing this
blog. Then I shall most likely include some kind of link pointing you to another part of the blog.

Well, here goes... My name is Samuel Holt, but most people call me Sam. It's not a great name,
definitely some kind of syllabic imbalance going on there. I grew up on the streets of suburban Wellington,
and also in my house, with my middle-class, loving family. I love Wellington, and New Zealand for that matter,
I intend to stay here for many, many years, _until climate change forces us to evacuate the planet_.

I've been writing code since before I was born, that's not to say I'm exceptionally good at it,
I really just enjoy problem solving and building stuff what works good. I spend my days as a front-end web developer,
 building websites and apps. I heartily enjoy every part of the process, and hope to one day own some kind of pizza
 company that also builds web apps.

I'm writing this blog to give me something to do, force me to get a move on with my personal projects,
and of course to boost my
profile, gain favour with rich and powerful potential employers,
who I hope will one day employ me.

So far I've only got a few pages, so why not check out the [contact page!]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) OMG so much
pages!
